I developed this project during my second internship at MoodMe and presented it at the Tokyo Game Show 2021. The aim of the project was to develop a tool which can analyze and report emotions and actions of a player during a stage, in order to improve Game feel and Game Play. This uses Augmented Reality features, such as Barrucada and ONNX Models.
